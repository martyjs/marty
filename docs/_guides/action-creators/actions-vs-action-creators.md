There has been some confusion around actions and action creators. In the [original blog announcing Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html), [action creators were called actions](http://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html#actions). Since then, the creators of Flux have [decided to rename actions to action creators](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/reactjs/jBPHH4Q-8Sc/zwObiX9UT2EJ) because "they create actions but are not themselves actually the action itself".

Utilmately this is just semantics so actions and action creators are terms that can be used interchangeably.
